      <p>
        In this section we describe, generally, how we have collected and disclosed personal data
        about you in the prior 12 months (from the Last Updated date above). As noted above the data

        <li>social networks;</li>
        <li>operating systems and platforms;</li>
        <li>entities conducting networking events;</li>
        <li>publicly available sources;</li>

    <section>
      Under the CCPA, a “sale” includes disclosing or making available to a third party personal
      data, in exchange for monetary compensation or some other value or benefit. While we do not
      disclose personal data in exchange for monetary compensation, we may make certain categories
      of personal data available in order to receive certain benefits or services, such as when we
      make browsing information available to third party ad companies (through third party tags on
      our Sites) in order to improve and measure our ad campaigns and reach users with more relevant
      ads and content.
    </section>

      business partners, service providers, affiliates and subsidiaries, advertising and promotional
      agencies and networks, consultants and those organisations or online platforms selected by us
      to carry out marketing campaigns on our behalf and to advertise their own products or services
      that may be of interest to you.
