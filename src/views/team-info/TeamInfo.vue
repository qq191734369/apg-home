      <p>

        otherwise.  It is your responsibility to check these Terms regularly before using any of our

    <section>
      <p><em>4.Account</em></p>
      <p>
        1.To use certain of our Services you may be required to create an account with us and/or
        with the third party platform operator e.g. Apple or Google (Account).  To create an
        Account, you must provide truthful and accurate information about yourself on the Account
        registration page and keep that information up-to-date.  You may not share your Account with
        others and are solely responsible for keeping the login credentials to your Account
        confidential.  You are responsible for all activities associated with your Account. We may
        Stop your Account or permanently remove any content or Virtual Items from any of our
        Services at our reasonable  discretion if we have reasonable grounds for believing you have
        violated any of these Terms. References to “Stopping” or to “Stop” an Account includes
        temporarily or permanently disabling, suspending, banning or muting an Account. If your
        Account is muted, you can continue to play but will not be able to use free text chat during
        the relevant muting period. If your Account is disabled or banned, you will no longer be
        able to access your Account and any licenses previously granted to you to use our Games and
        Services will be either temporarily or permanently revoked. THIS MEANS YOU WILL LOSE YOUR
        ACCOUNT, CHARACTERS AND ANY IN-GAME ITEMS OR CURRENCY. More information about when we may
        Stop your Account can be found in section 4.2 of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.If, acting reasonably, we consider that: (i) these Terms have or may have been breached or
        may likely be breached by you; and/or (ii) you have committed fraudulent, unlawful or
        abusive activity including any breach or suspected breach of the rules of conduct set out in
        section 8 of these Terms; and/or (iii) it is necessary in order to prevent or stop any harm
        or damage to us, to any our Games or Services, to other players, the general public or to
        you, then it is in our reasonable sole discretion, that we may at any time: (i) Stop (as
        defined) any part or all of your Accounts; (ii) restrict your access to any
        content-uploading or other features of our Games or Services; and/or (iii) restrict your
        access to or delete Virtual Items or anything you have acquired by means of Virtual Items.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.If we take any of the above actions, you may raise your concern by contacting our customer
        services via Email: <EmailLink />. 4.We do not guarantee the ongoing supply of any games or
        services or that content will be available at all times, in all locations, or at any given
        time or that will continue to offer such games, services and content for a particular length
        of time.

      <p><em>5.Deletion and Recovery of your Account</em></p>

      <p>
        1.If you want to permanently delete your account you may easily request your account
        deletion at any time under your profile in the Game.        
      </p>
      <p>
        2.When you request to delete your account, you will need to answer two questions to identify
        you as the true account owner, which answers will enable us to successfully verify your
        account information. Subsequently, the account deletion process will automatically begin,
        subject to a 15-day cooling-off period, before the account including all its items and
        content will automatically be fully and irreversibly deleted. Whilst the deletion process is
        being undertaken, during the cooling-off period, your account will be deactivated and any
        content associated with the account will no longer be accessible by you but will continue to
        be visible to other users until the expiration of the cooling-off period. During the
        cooling-off period you will have the opportunity to recall your deletion request by sending
        us a message via the in-game portal or to <EmailLink />. If you do not recall your account
        within the cooling-off period, your account will, upon the expiration of the cooling-off
        period, automatically be irreversibly, fully and permanently deleted, including all items
        purchased and other associated content under your account. Following the deletion of your
        account and associated content, it may take us up to another 30 days to remove it from
        backups and disaster recovery systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.The deletion of your account and any content associated with your account may  not be
        permanently deleted where deletion would restrict our ability to: (i) investigate or
        identify illegal activity or violations of our Terms and policies (for example, to identify
        or investigate misuse of our products or systems); (ii) protect the safety and security of
        our products, systems and users; (iii) comply with a legal obligation, such as the
        preservation of evidence; or (iv) comply with a request of a judicial or administrative
        authority, law enforcement or a government agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.If you have initiated the deletion or deactivation of your account by yourself (provided
        your account has not been deleted or deactivated by us due to your non-compliance with these
        Terms), then, until the expiration date of the cooling-off period (i.e. 15 calendar days
        from your deletion request), you will be able to recover or reactivate your account by
        contacting our customer services via the in-game portal or by email: <EmailLink />.
        Following such a request, you will need to answer two questions to identify you as the true
        account owner, which answers will enable us to successfully verify you as the legitimate
        account owner, recover your account and abort your account deletion process.

      <p><em>9.User Generated Content (UGC)</em></p>

      <p>
        1.User Generated Content (UGC) means any form of content generated by a user of the Services
        (including remarks, suggestions, ideas, graphics, text, images, video, information and
        messages) communicated, posted, uploaded, or sent by users on or in connection with the

      <p>
        We use the term Virtual Items to mean rights that we license to you to access or use certain

        unlockable content, additional or enhanced functionality (including multiplayer services),
        virtual assets, in-game achievements, and virtual points, coins and currencies.  When you
        sign up or pay for Virtual Items, we grant you a personal, limited, non-transferable,
        non-sub-licensable, revocable and non-exclusive license to access the selected Virtual
        Items.  Virtual Items have no monetary value and no other value outside of our Services.

      <p><em>11.Price, Payment and Tax</em></p>

      <p>
        1.We aim to ensure that the pricing of our Services (including Virtual Items, Games and any
        other goods and services available via third-party stores or on our store) are correct at
        all times.  However, the Game and website pages may not always accurately reflect the
        correct details at the moment at which you place your order.  We also reserve the right to
        change prices without prior notice at any time before the formation of the contract.  We
        cannot confirm the price of an item until your order is accepted.  Where you are resident in
        the European Union, we or our third-party stores will charge VAT or applicable sales tax on
        purchases as required by law, and you agree to provide the information we reasonably require
        in order to determine the applicable VAT or sales tax rate. 
      </p>

      <p>
        2.All credit and charge card holders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by
        the card issuer.  If the issuer of your payment card refuses to authorise payment to us,
        your order will not be accepted and we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery. 
      </p>

      <p>
        3.It is your own responsibility and you must comply with the terms and conditions applicable
        to your chosen payment method, as set by the payment provider.  We may add or remove any

        to you.

      <p><em>12.Contract</em></p>

        All purchase orders are subject to acceptance by us and availability of the Services.  If
        your order cannot be processed successfully, you will be notified of the reason and receive
        an explanation, if possible.  Please note that this acknowledgement email/message does not
        mean that your order has been accepted – your order merely constitutes an offer to us to
        purchase the Services.  All orders are subject to acceptance by us.  When we make the
        Services available e.g. as a download, this represents our legal acceptance of the offer you
        made to purchase the Services and the contract between us will then be formed (and we or the
        third party platform or service provider will debit your account).
